# AoC

### day 1
pretty easy, good start to the year, also i stayed up unti midnight to do the pproblem and it was super fun.
### day 2
Hated this problem, easy idea but it was a nightmare to keep track of the scores, the opponents play, and my play. Didn't realize rock paper scissors could be so complicated.
### day 3
This is my favorite day so far (As of writing this im on day 7), I had a blast figuring it out and just really enjoyed it.
### day 4
This was a fun one too but I had to do it a few days late since I was busy the day it released. 
### day 5
My boy Will had to help me parse correctly, after that it was chill. Realized afterwards that I could have just hardcoded the stacks and saved myself ~3 hours.
### day 6
Super easy, had fun doing it, pt 2 required 2-3 number to change in my code and then it ran just fine.
### day 7
shit got real, fast
Didnt know how to approach it but '0xdf' on youtube had a video and I used it to HEAVILY influence how I built the directories and how I did pt 1, pt 2 I did alone though.
video I used as "inspiration"
